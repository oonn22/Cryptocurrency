# Cryptocurrency
A node and protocol implementation of a cryptocurrency of my own design. Offers near instant transactions and asynchronous consensus through the implementation of the snowball consensus algorithm. Currently not in usable state as is susceptable to sybil attacks until proof of stake is implemented (or some other form of restricting node creation).
